# Nobu
I'm very new to Rust so I'm just playing around hoping stuff works.<br/>
Recently upgraded to serenity v0.5.0 which added a bunch of errors for me so it took awhile to fix all of them but now they're fix so I decided to open-source the bot.<br/>
This bot is a WIP project and should probably not be used on a serious Discord guild.<br/>
Nobu is also not hosted 24/7 and will have lots of down time.<br/>
If you still wish to invite her you can click [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=380101459062161409&scope=bot&permissions=66186303)<br/>
For questions you can join my Discord guild with [discord.gg/Vf4ne5b](https://discord.gg/Vf4ne5b)<br/><br/>
